				<h1>Lo and behold</h1>
				<p>To start this response, I would like to give a little recap of the video. The video titled Lo and behold was talking about how the internet as we know it was originally planned in the 1960's. However, the original plans were completely different to what we have today.  This video was short and to the point I really enjoyed this video. As someone who is smart with computers Lo and behold was very informative and interesting to see how someone can have an idea and that idea could be made into something much bigger. The original idea of links is a very interesting idea that I think should be put into modern day computers or even just programs like Microsoft word.</p>
